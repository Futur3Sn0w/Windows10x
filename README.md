# Quick Infos
This project is a very 'spur-of-the-moment' thing, and may not always be updated by me (@Futur3Sn0w).
However, I will be monitoring it closely, so if you want to make a pull request, go right ahead. I'll review the changes, and apply them as I see fit.

~~Each day I work on this, I'll make note of what I add/change below. If you're interested on what I did on a certain day, just look for the date (formatted MM/DD/YYYY) below.~~
I decided that this is kinda redundant since we have the to-do list. Major changes will be noted on twitter, things I've added & completed will be in the todo list!
Although I decided to create this rather suddenly, it has quickly become a passion project, and I will most likely work on it for as long as I can before my (rather limited) knowledge fails me, and I just can't do anything else.

If you follow me on twitter (www.twitter.com/futur3sn0w), you'll notice that anytime I post about the project, I use the #10XinHTML tag. This way, if I forget to update something here, or I want to talk about the project, you can click the tag to view all posts pertaining to the project. :D

# Using the site
The site is hosted at https://futur3sn0w.github.io/Windows10x/ 
The bar at the bottom (called the 'taskbar' or 'multibar') shows an indicator in the center, and the time on the right. Hovering over the indicator (or anywhere on the multibar) will expand it, revealing the Start Button and Task View button. It also expands the clock, and (in the future) reveals the icon for the Action Center, where you can access your toggles and sliders.
(More to be added in the future)
